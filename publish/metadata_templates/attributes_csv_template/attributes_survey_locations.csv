coordinate_method,"Description of the method used to assign latitude and longitude. Coordinates were not reported for all survey locations. Those that were reported are labelled as reported in database. For those that were missing or were determined to be incorrect, a coordinate from a location with the same name was selected at random and are labelled as assigned based on similar location. Location information was collected while in the field using a handheld unit. These units are known to have measurement error of plus or minus 20 meters. Coordinates were not consistently collected at the start or end of the survey transect meaning another 25 feet (length of transect) should be added to this range. For those where a proxy location was used, the range of error is much greater and can be assumed to be anywhere within the general location. ",character,,,NA,Not applicable
